          get fully and properly integrated into the community. <br /><br />At C-connect aim to provide person-centered,
          trauma-informed immigration and case management services that support participants in meeting basic needs,
          connecting with community resources, and working toward their self-identified goals. We recognize the resilience
          and strength of our clients and seek to tap into each participant&rsquo;s strengths and community connections for
          long-term stability and success. <br /><br />Our programs are developed to respond to the complex needs of
          immigrant families. The primary objective is to provide newly arrived immigrant families services not available
          from other agencies with cultural senilities and to make a positive and long-lasting impact on their lives. To
          achieve our goals, we provide our clients with referrals to organizations specializing in family and child
          welfare, Workforces Development, WIC programs and affordable childcare centers.</p>
